Pybo
================================

Pybo is a word tokenizer for the Tibetan language entirely written in Python.
Pybo takes in chuncks of text, and returns lists of words (each word is called
token). It provides an easy-to-use, high-performance tokenization pipeline that
can be adapted either as a stand-alone solution or compliment.
